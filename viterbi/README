This directory contains code for prototype Viterbi decoder for Link
Grammar. Actually, its not even a prototype, yet, since its hardly
begun, and it doesn't work.  The data structures vaguely resemble
those of the OpenCog AtomSpace; the reason for this is that they provide
a natural setting for storing Vitebrbi state information; that is, for
holding the various partly-finished parses, and effecting state
transformations on them.

Currently, the parser should be able to parse all single-word sentences
(yes, that sounds easy, but its not), and a handful of two-word sentences.

The vitest.cc file contains unit tests. Currently, it consists of some
21 tests that pass, and a 22nd one that fails.  We're working on it.
