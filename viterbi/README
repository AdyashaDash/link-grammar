This directory contains code for prototype Viterbi decoder for Link
Grammar. It barely functions and is currently very slow.

The goal of providing this decoder is to present a flexible, powerful
interface for implementing high-level semantic algorithms on top of
the the low-level link-grammar syntactic parser, and, in particular,
for steering the parse based on high-level semantic knowledge.  This
allows the parser to move beyond being merely a syntactic parser,
and to become fully integrated with general semantic artificial
intelligence.

The data structures used to implement this resemble those of the
OpenCog AtomSpace.  All data classs inherit from a class called Atom
(which is an atomic predicate, in the sense of mathematical logic).
Atoms further subdivide into Links and Nodes, thus all data is
represented in the form of a "term algebra" (aka the "Free Theory"
in the sense of model theory).  This structure allows all data to be
represented as (hyper-)graphs, which in turn makes the implementation
of graph algorithms easier to implement.  All these theoretical
considerations provide a natural setting for storing Vitebrbi state
information.  Put differently, this provide a generic, uniform way of
holding the various partly-finished parses, and effecting state
transformations on them.  

Making the internal state directly visible allows low-level syntactic
algorithms, as well as high-level, semantic algorithms to control parsing.
In other words, the intended use of the Viterbi decoder is to provide
a framework for parsing that should make it possible to integrate 
tightly (and cleanly) with high-level semantic analysis algorithms.
Thus, reference and anaphora resolution can be done using the same
graph structure as used for parsing; it should also allow graphical
transformations, such as those currently implemented in RelEx.
Annotation with word-sense data, entity markers and the like all become
possible and uniform using the same infrastructure.

Currently, the parser can correctly parse many short sentences.  It
currently runs very slowly, as no pruning algorithms have yet been
implemented.

To use this parser, you must run configure with the --enable-viterbi
flag:

   configure --enable-viterbi

Then, in the client, switch to the viterbi parser with the ! command
!viterbi  (If confused, try !help and !var for general help).

The vitest.cc file contains unit tests. Currently, it consists of 49
tests, and all of them pass.  More tests will be added.
