            PersianLG operating instructions

The persianparse.sh shows how the stemmer and the parser can be used
together.  In essence, its just:

   echo -e "my sentence\n" | stemmer.pl -u | link-parser fa

You can run persianparse.sh, by typing:

   ./persianparse.sh 'my sentence'

Most of the scripts included under the 'scripts' directory can be run by
typing (in this directory) './myscript.pl < myinput.txt > myoutput.txt'
