PersianLG installation instructions

1. Download the Link Grammar parser, available at:  http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/

2. Install it.  On newer Unix/Linux systems you can type 'tar -zxvf link-4.1b.tar.gz'.
   On older systems you can type 'tar -xvf link-4.1b.tar.gz; gunzip link-4.1b.tar'.
   Then 'cd link-4.1;  ./configure;  make'  As root, type 'make install'.  
   Now you have the link grammar parser installed.

3. In order to run persianparse.sh (the short way of parsing a sentence), type
   the full path of the link grammar parser binary followed by the full path
   of the Persian version of the file 4.0.dict into the file persianparse.sh .

4. Now you run persianparse.sh, by typing:
   persianparse.sh 'my sentence'

5. In order to run persianlg.sh (the long, but more customizable way of parsing
   a sentence), type the full path of the parser binary after the 
   word LGPARSERHOME.  Then type the full path of the Persian version of the
   file 4.0.dict after the word FA_LGHOME.

6. Now you run persianlg.sh, by typing:
   source persianlg.sh
   echo -e "my sentence\n" | /path/to/stemmer.pl <any flags> | persianlg


Most of the scripts included under the 'scripts' directory can be run by
typing (in this directory) './myscript.pl < myinput.txt > myoutput.txt'
