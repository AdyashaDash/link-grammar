/*
	Here's a summary of how subscripts are handled:

	Reading the dictionary:

	  If the last "." in a string is followed by a non-digit character,
	  then the "." and everything after it is considered to be the subscript
	  of the word.

	  The dictionary reader does not allow you to have two words that
	  match according to the criterion below.  (so you can't have
	  "dog.n" and "dog")

	  Quote marks are used to allow you to define words in the dictionary
	  which would otherwise be considered part of the dictionary, as in

	   ";": {@Xca-} & Xx- & (W+ or Qd+) & {Xx+};
	   "%" : (ND- & {DD-} & <noun-sub-x> &
		   (<noun-main-x> or B*x+)) or (ND- & (OD- or AN+));

	Rules for chopping words from the input sentence:

	   First the prefix chars are stripped off of the word.  These
	   characters are "(" and "$" (and now "``")

	   Now, repeat the following as long as necessary:

		   Look up the word in the dictionary.
		   If it's there, the process terminates.

		   If it's not there and it ends in one of the right strippable
		   strings (see "strip_right") then remove the strippable string
		   and make it into a separate word.

		   If there is no strippable string, then the process terminates.

	Rule for defining subscripts in input words:

	   The subscript rule is followed just as when reading the dictionary.

	When does a word in the sentence match a word in the dictionary?

	   Matching is done as follows: Two words with subscripts must match
	   exactly.  If neither has a subscript they must match exactly.  If one
	   does and one doesn't then they must match when the subscript is
	   removed.  Notice that this is symmetric.

	So, under this system, the dictonary could have the words "Ill" and
	also the word "Ill."  It could also have the word "i.e.", which could be
	used in a sentence.
