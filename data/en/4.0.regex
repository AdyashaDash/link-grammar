% This file contains regular expressions that are used to match
% tokens not found in the dictionary. Each regex is given a name which
% determines the disjuncts assigned when the regex matches; this name
% must be defined in the dictionary along with the appropriate disjuncts.
% Note that the order of the regular expressions matters: matches will
% be attempted in the order in which the regexs appear in this file,
% and only the first match will be used.

% Numbers.
% Stubbed out unttil tokenize.c is properly fixed up.
% NUMBERS: /^[0-9:.,-]+$/
% NUMBERS: /^[0-9.-]+\([0-9.-]+\)$/  % PubMed ASCII for exponent, e.g. "10(3)"
% NUMBERS: /^[0-9.,-]*\+\/-[0-9,.-]+$/ % with "+/-", e.g. "9+/-6.5"

% Some "safe" derived units. Simple units are in dictionary.
% The idea here is for the regex to match something that is almost
% certainly part of a derived unit, and allow the rest to be
% anything; this way we can capture difficult derived units such
% as "mg/kg/day" and even oddities such as "micrograms/mouse/day"
% without listing them explicitly.
% TODO: add more. 
% Some (real) misses from these: 
% micrograms.kg-1.h-1 microM-1 J/cm2 %/day mN/m cm/yr

%UNITS: /^([npmk]|nano|pico|milli|micro|kilo)?(g|grams?)\//   % grams/anything
%UNITS: /^([fnmp]|femto|nano|micro|pico|mu)?mol(es)?\//       % mol/anything
%UNITS: /^[a-zA-Z\/.]+\/((m|micro)?[lLg]|kg|mol|min|day|h)$/  % common endings
% common endings, except in the style "mg.kg-1" instead of "mg/kg".
%UNITS: /^[a-zA-Z\/.1-]+\.((m|micro)?[lLg]|kg|mol|min|day|h)(-1|\(-1\))$/

% combinations of numbers and units, e.g. "50-kDa", "1-2h"
% TODO: Clean up and check that these are up-to-date wrt the 
% dictionary-recognized units; this is quite a mess currently.

% Hyphenated words. In the original LG morpho-guessing system that
% predated the regex-based system, hyphenated words were detected
% before ING-WORDS, S-WORDS etc., causing e.g. "cross-linked" to be
% treated as a HYPHENATED-WORD (a generic adjective/noun), and
% never a verb. To return to this ordering, move this regex just
% after the CAPITALIZED-WORDS regex.
