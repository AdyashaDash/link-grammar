Research notes.

There are currently 63 data files in the 'words' directory.
Of these, 8 are not distinct (*biolg*, *medical*) and so there
are effectively just 55 "clusters" here.

There are 1754 semicolons in 4.0.dict and 1772 colons.  This implies
that there are approx 1650 to 1700 word clusters in 4.0.dict
