Language Directories
--------------------

de -- German. Contains distionaries for a few thousand words, that's
      all. Incomplete.

en -- English. Complete set.

lt -- Lithuanian. Contains dictionaries for a few dozen words, and no
      more. Enough for simple tests.

ru -- Russian.  Fairly complete set of dictionaries, should parse most
      text. Could use work on supporting regular expressions for numbers,
      Russian-ized Latin technical terms, etc.  See the English 4.0.regex
      file for more.

any -- Will parse "any" language, exploring all combinatoric possibilities.
       This is useful for certain machine-learning tasks, when one might
       want to iterate over all possible parse trees in every way.
