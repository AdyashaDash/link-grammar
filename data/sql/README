                Parse Ranking and Word Sense Statistics
                ---------------------------------------

This directory contains SQL tables that are used in computing a parse
ranking, as well as a word-sense probability (based on WordNet 3.0) by
looking up frequency statistics from an SQL database. The database used
is the SQLite database; it has been choosen because it is "administration
-free" for the user, and because its license is compatbile with the
current link-grammar license.


The disjuncts.db database contains a single table:

CREATE TABLE Disjuncts (
   inflected_word TEXT NOT NULL,
   disjunct TEXT NOT NULL,
   log_cond_probability FLOAT
);

The log_cond_probability field contains the value of -log_2 p(d|w)
where p(d|w) is the conditional probability of seeing the disjunct d
given that the (inflected) word w was already seen.


Notes:
------
To populate this table:
pg_dump -D -O -t disjuncts lexat
