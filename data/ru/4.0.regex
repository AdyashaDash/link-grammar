% This file contains regular expressions that are used to match
% tokens not found in the dictionary. Each regex is given a name which
% determines the disjuncts assigned when the regex matches; this name
% must be defined in the dictionary along with the appropriate disjuncts.
% Note that the order of the regular expressions matters: matches will
% be attempted in the order in which the regexs appear in this file,
% and only the first match will be used.

% XXXXXXXX TODO: the russian dictionary currently does not use this!

% Allows at most two colons in hour-muinute-second HH:MM:SS expressions
% Allows at most two digits between colons
HMS-TIME: /^[0-9][0-9]?(:[0-9][0-9]?(:[0-9][0-9]?)?)?(AM|PM|am|pm)?$/

% Allows any number of commas or periods
% Be careful not match the period at the end of a sentence; 
% for example: "It happened in 1942."
NUMBERS: /^[0-9,.]*[0-9]$/
% This parses signed numbers and ranges, e.g. "-5" and "5-10" and "9+/-6.5"
NUMBERS: /^[0-9.,-]*[0-9](\+\/-[0-9.,-]*[0-9])?$/
% Parses simple fractions e.g. "1/60" with no decimal points or anything fancy
FRACTION: /^[0-9]+\/[0-9]+$/
% "10(3)" exponent (used in PubMed)
NUMBERS: /^[0-9.,-]*[0-9][0-9.,-]*\([0-9:.,-]*[0-9][0-9.,-]*\)$/

% Roman numerals
% The first expr has the potential(?) problem that it matches an empty
% string. Thus, the next three rules specify that at least one section
% is non-empty.
ROMAN-NUMERAL-WORDS: /^M*(CM|D?C{0,3}|CD)(XC|L?X{0,3}|XL)(IX|V?I{0,3}|IV)$/
