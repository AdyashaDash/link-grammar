                  Regenerating the Russian Dictionaries
                  -------------------------------------

The raw data is located in the file morphs20030410.mrd.  This is the
master morphology file from 2003. The corresponding grammatical
markup is in rgramtab20030306.tab.

It is to be converted to Berkley DB files by running:

  time ./make-hash-db.pl

This will create the files root.db root.db and tail.db.  It should
take about 45 seconds or less to run.  These are then used to create
the link-grammar dictionaries:

  time ./mkdict.pl

This should take abput 25 seconds or less.  After this, the Russian
dictionaries are ready to be used!

The query-morph.pl tool will examine the morphology candidates for a
given word. For example:

  ./query-morph.pl тест



Misc notes:
-----------
iconv can be used to convert KOI8-R to UTF, as folllows:

      iconv -f KOI8-R -t UTF-8  <infile>  >   <outfile>
