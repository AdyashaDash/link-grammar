                  Regenerating the Russian Dictionaries
                  -------------------------------------

The raw data is located in the file morphs20030410.mrd.  This is the
master morphology file from 2003.

It is to be converted to Berkley DB files by running:

  time ./make-hash-db.pl

This will create the files root.db root.db and tail.db.  It should
take about 45 seconds or less to run.  These are then used to create
the link-grammar dictionaries:

  time ./mkdict.pl

This should take abput 25 seconds or less.  After this, the Russian
dictionaries are ready to be used!



Misc notes:
-----------
iconv can be used to convert KOI8-R to UTF, as folllows:

      iconv -f KOI8-R -t UTF-8  <infile>  >   <outfile>
