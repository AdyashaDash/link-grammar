The original dictionaries are in KOI8-R  ... to convert to UTF8, do this:

      iconv -f KOI8-R -t UTF-8  <infile>  >   <outfile>

Morphological dictionary encoded in *.db files; to convert
to the current form, run this script:

time ./mkdict.pl

This should take about 20 seconds (or less, on newer cpus).
